# SurveyMonkey Data Manipulation Project

## Introduction
This project involves manipulating a SurveyMonkey dataset with 198 rows and 100 columns. The goal is to clean and structure the data for further analysis, including identifying respondents, calculating how many answered specific questions, and determining which questions received maximum and minimum responses.

The data manipulation includes using pandas functions such as **JOIN**, **MERGE**, **GROUPBY**, **RENAME**, **MELT**, and **DROP** to convert the dataset into the desired format for analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary language for data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Library used for data manipulation, including joining, merging, grouping, and reshaping data.
- **Excel**: Exporting the final dataset for further analysis or visualization.

## Steps Involved
- **Importing the Dataset**
- **Copying the Dataset**
- **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**
- **Unpivoting the Data**
- **Renaming Columns**
- **Merging Tables**
- **Replacing NaN Values**
- **Calculating Respondents and Same Answers**
- **Exporting the Final Dataset**

## Conclusion
This project showcases how pandas can be used to manipulate and clean survey data, preparing it for detailed analysis. By unpivoting the data, merging datasets, and applying group functions, the dataset was transformed to allow further insights into response patterns.
